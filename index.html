	<p class="abstract line-clamp">Numerous studies have shown performance benefits from including whole-body vibration (WBV) whether as a training modality or an acute exercise protocol when utilized as a component of the resistance training program. Some studies have indicated that performing dynamic exercises as compared to static position exercises while exposed to WBV might be beneficial, however, evidence is lacking. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine if an acute bout of dynamic vs. static squats performed during WBV results in increases in quadriceps force production via dynamic isokinetic knee extension and flexion exercise.METHODS::Non-resistance-trained healthy young men and women (N=21) 18-25 yrs participated in 4 protocols with 2 wk rest in-between. Protocol 1 consisted of 5 sets of 10 dynamic squats without vibration; Protocol 2: 5 sets of 30-sec static squats without vibration; Protocol 3: 5 sets of 10 dynamic squats with 30 Hz WBV for total of 2.5 min; and Protocol 4: 5 sets of 30-sec static squats with 30 Hz WBV for total of 2.5 min. Pre-strength tests (1 set of 4 repetitions at 100°/sec for the knee extension exercise) was performed within 5 min of starting each protocol and post-strength testing was performed within 1 min of completing each protocol. Strength outcomes were analyzed via repeated measures ANOVA with a significance level set at p≤0.05.RESULTS::A significant decrease in strength was observed after dynamic and static squats without WBV (p=0.002); an increase in strength after dynamic squats with WBV (p=0.003); and a decrease in strength after static squats with WBV (p=0.003).DISCUSSION::The inclusion of WBV to dynamic resistance exercise can be an added modality to increase strength. WBV can have varied effects in altering muscle strength in untrained individuals according to the type of resistance training performed.PRACTICAL APPLICATION::As a dynamic squat with WBV appears to immediately potentiate neuromuscular functioning, the combination of dynamic exercises and WBV could be utilized as a potential warm-up procedure prior to resistance exercise.</p>

	<h1>Whole-body vibration exposure in sport: four relevant cases.</h1>
	<p class="authors">Tarabini M, Saggin B, Scaccabarozzi D.</p>
	<p class="publication">Ergonomics. 2014 Sep 30:1-8. [Epub ahead of print]</p>
	<p class="abstract line-clamp">This study investigates the whole-body vibration exposure in kite surfing, alpine skiing, snowboarding and cycling. The vibration exposure was experimentally evaluated following the ISO 2631 guidelines. Results evidenced that the most critical axis is the vertical one. The weighted vibration levels are always larger than 2.5 m/s2 and the vibration dose values are larger than 25 m/s1.75. The exposure limit values of the EU directive are reached after 8-37 min depending on the sport. The vibration magnitude is influenced by the athletes' speed, by their skill level and sometimes by the equipment. The large vibration values suggest that the practice of sport activities may be a confounding factor in the aetiology of vibration-related diseases. Practitioner Summary: The vibration exposure in some sports is expected to be large, but has never been quantified in the literature. Results of experiments performed in cycling, alpine and water sports outlined vibration levels exceeding the EU standard limit values.</p>

	<p class="abstract line-clamp">This study investigated changes in the physiological and behavioral responses to repetitive asymmetric lifting activity after exposure to whole body vibrations. Seventeen healthy volunteers repeatedly lifted a box (15% of lifter's capacity) positioned in front of them at ankle level to a location on their left side at waist level at the rate of 10 lifts/minute for a period of 60 minutes. Prior to lifting, participants were seated on a vibrating platform for 60 minutes; in one of the two sessions the platform did not vibrate. Overall, the physiological responses assessed using near-infrared spectroscopy signals for the erector spinae muscles decreased significantly over time during the seating and the lifting tasks (p  0.001). During repetitive asymmetric lifting, behavioral changes included increases in peak forward bending motion, twisting moment and three-dimensional movement velocities of the spine. The lateral bending moment of the spine and the duration of each lift decreased significantly over the 60 minutes of repetitive lifting. With exposure to whole body vibration, participants twisted further (p = 0.046) and twisted faster (p = 0.025). These behavioral changes would suggest an increase in back injury risk when repetitive lifting tasks are preceded by whole body vibration exposure.</p>

	<h1>The Effects of Vibration on the Gait Pattern and Vibration Perception Threshold of Children.</h1>
	<p class="authors">Fanchiang HD, Geil M, Wu J, Chen YP, Wang YT.</p>

	<p class="abstract line-clamp">The effectiveness of idiopathic toe walking treatments is not conclusive. The study investigated the use of vibration as a therapeutic/treatment method for children with idiopathic toe walking. Fifteen children with idiopathic toe walking and 15 typically developing children, aged 4 to 10 years, completed the study. The study included a barefoot gait examination and a vibration perception threshold test before and after standing on a whole body vibration machine for 60 seconds. Temporal-spatial parameters were recorded along with HR32, a calculation designed to distinguish on aspects of the toe-walking pattern. No significant gait pattern differences were found between children with idiopathic toe walking and typically developing children after one bout of vibration intervention. HR32 was found to be a means to identify the toe-walking pattern (P < .001). Hypersensitivity to vibration of children with idiopathic toe walking was not found in the current study (P = .921).

	<h1>Intermittent whole-body vibration attenuates a reduction in the number of the capillaries.</h1>

	<p class="abstract line-clamp">BACKGROUND:
	Whole-body vibration has been suggested for the prevention of muscle mass loss and muscle wasting as an attractive measure for disuse atrophy. This study examined the effects of daily intermittent whole-body vibration and weight bearing during hindlimb suspension on capillary number and muscle atrophy in rat skeletal muscles.
	METHODS:
	Sixty male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (CONT), hindlimb suspension (HS), HS + weight bearing (WB), and HS + whole-body vibration (VIB) (n = 15 each). Hindlimb suspension was applied for 2 weeks in HS, HS + WB, and HS + VIB groups. During suspension, rats in HS + VIB group were placed daily on a vibrating whole-body vibration platform for 20 min. In HS + WB group, suspension was interrupted for 20 min/day, allowing weight bearing. Untreated rats were used as controls.
	RESULTS:
	Soleus muscle wet weights and muscle fiber cross-sectional areas (CSA) significantly decreased in HS, HS + WB, and HS + VIB groups compared with CONT group. Both muscle weights and CSA were significantly greater in HS + WB and HS + VIB groups compared with HS group. Capillary numbers (represented by capillary-to-muscle fiber ratio) were significantly smaller in all hindlimb suspension-treated groups compared with CONT group. However, a reduction in capillary number by unloading hindlimbs was partially prevented by whole-body vibration. These findings were supported by examining mRNA for angiogenic-related factors. Expression levels of a pro-angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor-A mRNA, were significantly lower in all hindlimb suspension-treated groups compared with CONT group. There were no differences among hindlimb suspension-treated groups. Expression levels of an anti-angiogenic factor, CD36 (receptor for thrombospondin-1) mRNA, were significantly higher in all hindlimb suspension-treated groups compared with CONT group. Among the hindlimb suspension-treated groups, expression of CD36 mRNA in HS + VIB group tended to be suppressed (less than half the HS group).
	CONCLUSIONS:
	Our results suggest that weight bearing with or without vibration is effective for disuse-derived disturbance by preventing muscle atrophy, and whole-body vibration exercise has an additional benefit of maintaining microcirculation of skeletal muscle.</p>
